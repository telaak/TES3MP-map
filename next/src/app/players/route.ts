/**
 * @route /players
 * @summary Player snapshot ingestion & retrieval endpoint.
 * @description Accepts batched player state snapshots from the TES3MP server (see `server/map.lua`) and
 * exposes the latest snapshot via `GET` for UI / polling clients.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The POST body always represents an authoritative full snapshot (not a diff). When no players are online
 * the server-side script sends `{ players: [] }` exactly once on transition to empty; this route then
 * persists the empty array until the next non-empty snapshot arrives.
 *
 * @example POST payload
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "players": [
 *     {
 *       "name": "Player1",
 *       "head": "argonian_f_head_01",
 *       "hair": "argonian_f_hair01",
 *       "race": "Argonian",
 *       "isMale": 1,
 *       "stats": {
 *         "baseHealth": 100,
 *         "currentHealth": 95,
 *         "baseMagicka": 50,
 *         "currentMagicka": 50,
 *         "baseFatigue": 200,
 *         "currentFatigue": 180,
 *         "level": 5
 *       },
 *       "location": {
 *         "cell": "Balmora",
 *         "regionName": "Ascadian Isles",
 *         "posX": 123.4,
 *         "posY": 567.8,
 *         "posZ": 90.1,
 *         "previousX": 120,
 *         "previousY": 560,
 *         "previousZ": 90
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @returns For GET: `Player[]` â€” the latest in-memory snapshot (empty array if none).
 * @security Shared secret header. The POST request must include `X-Map-Auth: <MAP_SHARED_SECRET>`
 * configured in the server environment. Requests missing or with an incorrect secret are rejected
 * with HTTP 401.
 * @see server/map.lua for producer of snapshot payloads.
